State Abbreviator
===================
Let's continue experimenting with state, props, inputs, and transforming arrays by creating:

 1. A select input/dropdown menu that contains a list of US states
 2. A component that displays the abbreviation of the selected US state once you select a state from the dropdown.

Objectives
-------------

 1. Scaffold the app using create-react-app
 2. Move `statedata` directory in the root of this repo into your ./src directory (code outside of the ./src directory isn't compiled, so you'll get errors if you try to import this file from it's default location).
 3. `import` the state data from `statedata/index.js` and use it to construct the UI detailed above.
